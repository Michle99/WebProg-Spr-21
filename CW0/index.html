  <dt>Spring</dt>
  <dd>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer.</dd>

  <dt>Summer</dt>
  <dd>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and before autumn. At or around the summer solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.</dd>
  <dt>Fall</dt>
  <dd>Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September or March, when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.</dd>
  <dt>Winter</dt>
  <dd>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones; it does not occur in most of the tropical zone. It occurs after autumn and before spring in each year.</dd>
