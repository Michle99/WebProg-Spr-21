    <h3>The future belongs to generalists</h3>
    <p>But as the typical mutual fund disclaimer so famously states, past performance is no guarantee of future results. It’s time to rethink our love affair with depth. The pendulum between depth and breadth has swung too far in favor of depth. There’s
        an oft-quoted saying that “to a man with a hammer, everything looks like nails.” But what if that man had a hammer, a screwdriver, and a wrench? Might he or she look to see if the flat top had a narrow slit, suggesting the use of a screwdriver?
        Or perhaps consider the shape of the flat top. Circle? Hexagon? Could a wrench be a more effective tool? And finally, the mere addition of these tools can encourage a better understanding of a problem. This is not to suggest that deep expertise
        is useless. Au contraire. Carrying a hammer is not a problem. It’s just that our world is changing so rapidly that those with more tools in their possession will better navigate the uncertainty. To make it in today’s world, it’s important to be
        agile and flexible.</p>


    <h2>What is means to be a generalist</h2>
    <p>How does one do this? To begin, it’s important to zoom out and pay more attention to the context in which you’re making decisions. Read the whole paper, not just the section about your industry. Is your primary focus oil and gas? Study the dynamics
        affecting the retail sector. Are you a finance professional? Why not read a book on marketing? Think bigger and wider than you’ve traditionally done. Another strategy is to think about how seemingly unrelated developments may impact each other,
        something that systems thinkers do naturally. Study the interconnections across industries and imagine how changes in one domain can disrupt operations in another one. Because generalists have a set of tools to draw from, they are able to dynamically
        adjust their course of action as a situation evolves. Just think of how rapidly the world changed with the development of the Internet and wireless data technologies. Jeff Bezos was not a retail specialist who took on his competitors and won.
        He was a relative newcomer to retail but was able to adapt rapidly to seize a gigantic opportunity. </p>
