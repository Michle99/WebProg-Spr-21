    <p>Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way that a page is displayed. <br> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of markingup the structure of a document not as a way of determining
        its presentation.
        <p>Formatting text to apperar on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear</p> in a printed document.

        <p>The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

        The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
        
        By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
        
        An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        A visited link is underlined and purple
        An active link is underlined and red
