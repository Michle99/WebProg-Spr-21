<p style="text-align: left" clear="left">Park City native, Laura Blake, won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best long distance runners in the country.
	Laura's time of 2hr 28 min 21 sec was only 2 minutes off the women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasjer and Lisa Peterson finished second and third respectively.
	Larua's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.
	In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's marathon for the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of Cutler, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.

This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, 
with over 9500 men and 6700 women competing. 
Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.
The 124th Boston Marathon finally got underway this weekend, but virtually â€” meaning runners do the work, 
and an interactive app augments the experience.

Rather than lining up in Hopkinton and making the famed trek to the Boston's Copley Square, 
the Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race, 
asked athletes to run this year's marathon on their own because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Runners must still complete a 26.2-mile-long trek without any stops, 
but they can choose any day between Sept. 5 and Sept. 14 to do so. 
Only those previously registered for the 2020 Boston Marathon may compete. Runners are also allowed to use a treadmill.
